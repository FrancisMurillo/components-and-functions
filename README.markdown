# frontend-functions

This presentation is for the [5th Functional Programming Users Group Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/scala-manila/events/234894294/) where I talk about ReactJS as components and how it parallels functions.

# Viewing the presentation

This uses [https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown) which is a React presentation framework.

Just run `npm install` to build it, `npm start` to start the presentation and then find it at `http://localhost:33000`.
